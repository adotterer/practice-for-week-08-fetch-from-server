# Practice: Writing Fetch Reqeusts

In this practice, you will be writing fetch requests that will interact with the server from the HTML Templating practice. 

## Set up

Clone the project from the [starter]. Run `npm  install`. Run the tests with `npm test`.

## Background and Context

You will be making fetch requests already integrated with your HTML page. Your job is to make the fetch calls to the correct endpoints and with the correct options. 

Write your code in `assets/js/your-code.js`.
